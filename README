A very simple web framework that runs on Android Devices based on the built in Apache HTTP Core. 

I developed this primarily for writing development tools on the Android Platform (see https://github.com/nicstrong/android-browser) and as such there is no consideration for anything that you would expect out of a normal web server (e.g security, standards compliance). Please bare that in mind.
